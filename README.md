# Linear-Regression
Dataset,
First lets look at the dataset. It is Salary_Data.csv
It has 2 columns - "Years of Experience" and "Salary" for 30 employees in a company. 
So in this example, we will train a Simple Linear Regression model to learn the correlation between the number of years of experience of each employee and their respective salary. Once the model is trained, we will be able to do some Sample Predictions.
